	<p>Eveve provide the World's most dynamic live restaurant booking systems.  The two key components of the restaurant reservation system are the live table management system and the live booking pages.  The former manages your restaurant's availability for the latter, which is a conduit for new restaurant bookings.</p><br />
	<p>We recognise that every restaurant is different, and we suit our systems to your restaurant - not the other way around.  Some restaurants are looking to take advantage of structured online bookings, but do not need extensive table management.  Other restaurants seek the opposite.  Whatever your restaurant's needs, it is likely we can accommodate them.</p><br />
	<p>We provide three core systems, which in their various modified states, can cater for most restaurants' needs: </p><br /><br />
	<div id="info_box"><p><b>Online bookings only</b>: The restaurant continues to use a paper diary, allocating a small number of tables for online.  If these tables are otherwise used, their availability is modified with a very easy to use restaurant control console.  <a href="restaurants/onlinebooking.htm">Click here to find out more about this restaurant booking system.</a></p></div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><p><b>Live Table Management</b>: The restaurant computerises its diary, and all bookings, whether online, telephone or walk in are recorded.  <a href="restaurants/livetable.htm">Click here to find out more about this restaurant booking system.</a></p></div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><p><b>Client Relationship Management System</b>: As the standard system, but records who is eating at the restaurant, together with useful information such as eating preferences, average spend, address, telephone number etc.  <a href="restaurants/crm.htm">Click here to find out more about this restaurant booking system.</a></p></div><br /><br />
	<p>All three of these systems integrate effortlessly with restaurant EPOS tills, restaurant web sites, restaurant events, and room booking systems.<br /><br /><br /></p>
	<img src="images/business_case.jpg" alt="Restaurant Reservation System" /><br /><br />
	<img src="images/more_control.jpg" alt="Restaurant Booking System" /><br /><br />
	<p>More people than ever before are using the internet and booking restaurants online.  If you are online you are tapping into this huge growing market.  If you are not online, you are missing out.</p><br />
	<p>Live online bookings through your restaurant's website work 24/7 and regardless of how busy the restaurant is.  How many times has the telephone rung out or hit engaged on a busy Friday night at 8pm, or not been answered early in the morning?  Did the customer ring back or go elsewhere?  With a live restaurant booking system, you can convert more of your website visitors by allowing every customer to book online at their convenience.</p><br /><br />	
	<p>The case for an Eveve live restaurant booking system is more than just going online.  Our software allows you to control the online booking process.  The customer interacts with the table availability system to check for space.  Moreover, their requests are made within the prism of your restaurant's rules, such as 10 covers per half hour; 40 seats total restaurant capacity; no groups over 10 etc.  If there is space in your restaurant, they receive a live confirmation, if not, an alternative time is offered.</p><br /><br />
	<p>Eveve Live Restaurant Booking Systems offer distinct advantages:</p><br />
	<div id="info_box"><p><b>Total Restaurant Control:</b> bookings are only allowed if they fit within your restaurant's booking rules, which gives you total control.  You have booking rules because structured bookings are more profitable, and reduce stress.  Now your restaurant's online bookings can be structured.</p></div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><p><b>Reduce Restaurant Workload:</b> every email request needs a reply, which increases workload.</p></div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><p><b>Instant Restaurant Confirmation:</b> a customer who receives instant confirmation is less inclined to book elsewhere, than one awaiting confirmation.</p></div><br /><br />
	<p><img src="images/total_restaurant_solution.jpg" alt="total restaurant solution"/><br /><br />
	Eveve provide the total IT package for restaurants.  All of our live restaurant software is designed to be fully integrated, and we provide all the IT your restaurant might need, including live restaurant table reservations systems; restaurant EPOS; restaurant websites; restaurant IT support; restaurant consultancy; restaurant takeaway systems; room reservation systems and restaurant client relationship management.<br /><br />
	We are a software house, not a marketing company, so if there is something you want, which we do not have, ask us.  We might be able to build it specially.<br /><br />
	Integration of systems provides three key advantages : <br /><br /></p>
	<div id="info_box"><b>More powerful:</b> integrating information across systems makes them more powerful.  A restaurant management system, which takes booking from your restaurant's website, and knows which diners are guests in the rooms, is much more powerful.</div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><b>Avoid duplication of work:</b> running simultaneous reservations systems often results in customer or booking information being entered multiple times.</div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><b>Responsibility:</b> a major problem with multiple suppliers is getting one to take responsibility if something does not work.  If Eveve provide your entire restaurant IT solution, we take responsibility for your IT.</div><br />
	<img src="images/revolutionary_for_restaurants.jpg" alt="revolutionary for restaurants"/><br /><br />
	<div id="info_box"><b>Imagine extra reservations</b> for your restaurant, by allowing your customers to book and confirm in real time, whatever the time.</div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><b>Imagine total control</b> of your restaurant, with real time bookings which fit around your restaurant's structure and existing reservations.</div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><b>Imagine seamless integration</b> with your restaurant's electronic tills, websites, e-marketing and restaurant consultancy.</div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><b>Imagine integrated portals</b> from influential restaurant websites which are fully integrated with your restaurant's other reservations.</div><br />
	<div id="info_box"><b>Imagine dedicated professionals</b> specialising in restaurants, who provide unparalleled customer support and service.</div><br /><br />
