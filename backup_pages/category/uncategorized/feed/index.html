In general, most of Eveve’s clients are full service, and so this blog will be most helpful to such restaurants, but hopefully it can be of value to restaurateurs in the quick service sphere as well.  After working with so many restaurants, we analysed the top 10% and what makes them so successful.  This blog forms the second in a series of three, looking at the question from three different perspectives.

<ol>
<li><strong>The Food.</strong>  Even if a restaurant has been operating for years, there is no avoiding the importance of food in a restaurant’s success.  After all it is the reason your guests will leave the house in the first place.  Ensure that you have a chef whom you can trust, who can run a team which can prepare food in a timely manner, with consistent quality.  Make sure that the menu is not too long, to ensure you have the freshest food.  Invest in quality ingredients, it is the only way to ensure a superior product is being provided to your guests.  The execution of the food served is not Eveve’s speciality, but we know that food is the first and most basic issue.  If this is not addressed, there is little point in going on to the next points.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Ensure Sufficient Two-Top Tables.</strong> The cardinal sin of most architects is completely ignoring economic reality when designing floor layouts.  The fact is, the most common party size in fine dining restaurants is two, followed by four tops.  Even more important, two-tops tend to have a higher spend per head, and a shorter turn time, which means they earn far more per hour.  It is incredibly common for restaurants to have banks of large tables and booths, and a relatively small number of two-tops, often situated in the least hospitable parts of the restaurants.  The result is that most restaurants end up sitting two-tops on six person tables, even at times when they are full (running a waitlist), which is a huge waste of resources.  To ensure the profitability of your new venture, remember that you will probably get more two-tops than any other party size, they will spend more per head, and be in and out relatively quickly, so ensure plenty of two-tops, and that some of these are in nice locations, like beside the window.  Finally, it is easy to combine several two-tops in to a larger table, but you can not split a larger fixture like a booth between two or three parties.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Give Millenials What They Want.</strong> Millennials are now America’s biggest age group, and many have good jobs and few commitments, meaning significant discretionary income.  This makes Millenials the key audience for profit seeking restaurants.  Consider the hottest restaurants in your city right now, and it is likely they will be filled with well-paid millennials spending money liberally.  The issue with Millennials is that they are different from previous generations, and want different things.  The “restaurant experience” has become much more important, compared to the volume of food, price or convenience of the past.  If you want to attract Millennials, observe and learn from the restaurants in your city doing the best job (perhaps with farm-to-table, chef-driven creative concepts and healthy options) and avoid the 90s mistakes of high fat, pre-processed foods the emphasis of quantity over quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Accept Reservations.</strong> If your restaurant is full service, reservations are a must.  Not only are they requisite for the guest experience, but they are highly effective for the operator as well.  Walk-ins tend to come in large lumps, around 7pm for example, or Sunday Brunch at 10am.  A well planned reservation system is far more effective at smoothing the loading of diners over the whole shift versus walk-ins, which improves food and service consistency, improves the guest experience and your profit.  For more information of how to run your reservations to maximise profit, please see the third blog in our series <u>Blog 3 hyperlink</u></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Invest in a Lead Host:</strong> In Europe and New York it is not uncommon for the best paid member of staff to be the Maitre’d. And why not?  It is the most intellectually vigorous position in the restaurant when done correctly.  Yet in many American restaurants, the host team are the least well paid members of staff.  It is crucial to have one person beside the door who knows what they are doing.  Invest in a well-paid, experienced lead host or reservations manager, who understands the importance of maximising reservations and walk-ins, and is incentivised to manage the floor in a profitable way for your business.  In many of the most successful restaurants, the GM or restaurateur takes on this role themselves at weekends.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Greeting:</strong> Leading on from point four, it is essential that every guest who walks over the threshold is greeted enthusiastically and courteously within the first 10 seconds. If your host is dealing with another guest, they should be trained to at least look up at the new guest, make eye contact and say “Sir/Madam, I am just dealing with these guests, I will be with you in just a moment”.  Many of the most profitable restaurants ensure that servers who are available act as backup hosts when the latter are overloaded.  A busy restaurant is good for all team members.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Farewell:</strong> The corollary of greetings is farewells, and they are just as important, if not more so. How many times have you eaten in an expensive restaurant, only to pay and walk out without a thank you along the way?  The farewell is the final interaction with the guest, and if the dining experience was positive, it will reinforce a great memory.  If the experience was mediocre or poor, the farewell gives an opportunity to improve the experience or address a problem.  If you identify a problem at farewell, perhaps offer a gift card, so you can avert a negative online review and have the chance to win back that customer again.  Make sure your hosts take on the responsibility of bidding farewell to every one of your guests.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Keep Servers Away from the Host Stand during Service:</strong> Often when a server approaches a host stand during service, it is to find out how many diners are in their section(which they should have already been told before service started) and to hussle for more (at the expense of other hosts and the general welfare of the restaurant). In many cases this distorts the hosts decision-making prism and not in a good way.  The host’s objective becomes allocating or equalising guests by server, not maximising diners in your restaurants as a whole (which is what drives profit).  The desire to equalise server loading at any one time, can often result in over quoted wait times, and reservations being forced to wait, or being placed at a table which is too large for them—wasting the restaurant’s previous resources at busy times.  If server sections are cycled every shift, it will even out any irregularities within a single shift, and allow your hosts to focus on what they should be doing—maximising your profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Your restaurant probably cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions to renovate or build.  How much did you spend on your website?  <u>In 2015, your website is your sales and marketing platform.</u>  A well optimised website is how most of your new diners will discover your business.  In the grand scheme of things, a website is relatively inexpensive, with a high quality one available for between $1,000 and $3,000.  The revenue driven by the website will be tens of times the outlay and is crucial to your profitability, so do not scrimp on the cost with an amateur.  Choose a professional, and better still one which specialises in restaurants.  Eveve offers subsidised websites for new TELOS reservation system clients (<u>hyperlink</u>).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Social Media.</strong> In 2015, Social Media is critical in the portrayal of your restaurants and brand, but the delivery is crucial.  Avoid too many posts, diffuse messages, and irrelevant or generic material (such as a picture of a <em>drunk cat</em> or a <em>1920s Man</em> with the caption “it is Friday, drink wine”, seen on all too many restaurant Social Media postings).  When managing your social media presence, focus on short direct messages which clearly identify what <u>your</u> brand stands for and why people should visit <u>your</u> restaurant; showcase your food with sumptuous photography; and keep diners abreast of your upcoming events.  The upcoming events calendar is important to create a sense of buzz about your place.  No one wants to eat in a quiet or stale restaurant.</li>

<p><a href="http://www.monco.info/eveve/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How_Do_I_Make_My_Restaurant_More_Profitable_London.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5840 size-large" src="http://www.monco.info/eveve/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How_Do_I_Make_My_Restaurant_More_Profitable_London-1024x681.jpg" alt="How_Do_I_Make_My_Restaurant_More_Profitable_London" width="1024" height="681" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Location and Demographics: </strong>Invest in a good realtor who is an expert on locations and demographics in your city. What kind of demographic are you looking to attract?  Where does that demographic live in your city?  What do they like to eat?  If you are looking to serve urban professional hipsters, find out where a Whole Foods has opened recently, (why not piggy back on Wholefoods’ first rate demographic modelling).  If you are looking to open a New York style Steakhouse serving wealthy baby boomers, find out which part of the city buys the most Cadillacs.  A top class realtor must have an authoritative grasp of these facts.  Eveve can recommend first class realtors in Houston, Austin, Minneapolis, Cleveland and Denver.  Call us for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>When sourcing a location, adequate parking should be one of the first items on your list.  Unless your restaurant has access to first class public transport (and even if it does), your patrons will travel by car.  If they can not find parking, they may stay away.  Ensure your property has adequate parking, and if possible try and set up agreements with local businesses which have parking, but operate on daytime hours (such as Banks or hairdressers).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Over the years Eveve have worked with dozens of restaurants which have committed over a million dollars in renovating their property, but have opened without a website being live.  The fact that this still happens in 2015 is remarkable.  In the grand scheme of things, a website is relatively inexpensive, with a high quality one available for between $1,000 and $3,000.  The revenue driven by the website will be tens of times the outlay and is crucial to your profitability, so do not scrimp on the cost with a part-time nephew or friend, who might not have you live at least a month before opening.  Choose a professional, and better still one which specialises in restaurants.  Eveve offers subsidised websites for new TELOS reservation system clients (<u>hyperlink</u>).</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://www.monco.info/eveve/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How_Do_I_Make_My_Restaurant_More_Profitable_New-York.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5859 size-large" src="http://www.monco.info/eveve/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How_Do_I_Make_My_Restaurant_More_Profitable_New-York-1024x683.jpeg" alt="How_Do_I_Make_My_Restaurant_More_Profitable_New York" width="1024" height="683" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Great Concept.</strong> A disproportionate number of the most successful new restaurants are profitable because they give the dining public what they want, in many cases before the public know they want it.  Some restaurateurs are just great at predicting new trends, but one thing we can state after 10 years in the business, is to repeat that old adage “<em>there is nothing new under the Sun</em>”.  Even the most exciting American chefs borrow from the Spanish, French and Italian masters.  If you are stuck for some inspiration, why not spend a week in New York, San Sebastian or London, three of the most <em>avante garde</em> food cities.  See what is really clicking there, and the chances are, in a year or two it will be popular in your city too.  For gastronomic tours of Spain (home to 5 of the World’s top 20 restaurants, 2015), we recommend CASTILE TRAVEL www.castiletravel.com</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Overestimate your Capital Requirements.</strong> From experience we have seen dozens of restaurants spending over a million on renovation, only to shutter within six months.  Why?    In nearly every case, the restaurant assumed it would break even as soon as it opened; or the build costs were higher than expected, and the reserve fund for the first six months was used up for the build.  Either way, the bottom line is that it is common for restaurants to underestimate costs and actually go bust before they have really hit the ground running at six months.  Make sure you have enough capital in place for the build, start-up costs, a loss for six months, and some extra for unexpected events.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Ensure Sufficient Two-Top Tables.</strong> The cardinal sin of most architects is completely ignoring economic reality when designing floor layouts.  The fact is, the most common party size in fine dining restaurants is two, followed by four tops.  Even more important, two-tops tend to have a higher spend per head, and a shorter turn time, which means they earn far more per hour.  It is incredibly common for restaurants to have banks of large tables and booths, and a relatively small number of two-tops, often situated in the least hospitable parts of the restaurants.  The result is that most restaurants end up sitting two-tops on six person tables, even at times when they are full (running a waitlist), which is a huge waste of resources.  To ensure the profitability of your new venture, remember that you will probably get more two-tops than any other party size, they will spend more per head, and be in and out relatively quickly, so ensure plenty of two-tops, and that some of these are in nice locations, like beside the window.  Finally, it is easy to combine several two-tops in to a larger table, but you can not split a larger fixture like a booth between two or three parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Accept Reservations.</strong> If your restaurant is full service, reservations are a must.  Not only are they requisite for the guest experience, but they are highly effective for the operator as well.  Walk-ins tend to come in large lumps, around 7pm for example, or Sunday Brunch at 10am.  A well planned reservation system is far more effective at smoothing the loading of diners over the whole shift versus walk-ins, which improves food and service, consistency, the guest experience and your profit.  For more information of how to run your reservations to maximise profit, please see the third blog in our series <u>Blog 3 hyperlink</u></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Invest in a Lead Host:</strong> In Europe and New York it is not uncommon for the best paid member of staff to be the Maitre’d. And why not?  It is the most intellectually vigorous position in the restaurant when done correctly.  Yet in many American restaurants, the host team are the least well paid members of staff.  It is crucial to have one person beside the door who knows what they are doing.  Invest in a well-paid, experienced lead host or reservations manager, who understands the importance of maximising reservations and walk-ins, and is incentivised to manage the floor in a profitable way for your business.  In many of the most successful restaurants, the GM or restaurateur takes on this role themselves, at the weekend.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>If you are New to the Business, Open With a Restaurant Consultant.</strong> Restaurants have an incredibly high failure rate, and if you have never owned a restaurant before, the learning curve is painfully steep.  Working with an industry veteran can smooth the curve, and reduce the amount of your savings/investment which is burned approaching break-even.  Be wary of “consultants” however, as many are failed restaurateurs, who failed for a reason.  Always check references, plus their successes and failures.  If you are not sure where to find a consultant in your city, why not call the five restaurants you most admire locally, and ask them to recommend someone.  Most will be happy to help, and cross referencing their recommendations is useful.  Eveve offers specialised short term reservations and technology consultancy, which has a proven Return of Investment and has been deployed by some of America’s highest revenue restaurants.  In the specialised sphere of restaurant reservations consultancy, Eveve’s advice and 10 years of experience is peerless.  Eveve is not a full service consultancy, however, and can recommend a number of consultants for general consultancy outside the reservations sphere.</li>

The article explores Cleveland’s fine dining renaissance, and considers why restaurants are now choosing EVEVE for online reservations.</em></p>
<p>Cleveland is one of America’s great historic cities and has undergone a fine dining revolution in recent years. Cleveland is enjoying its moment as one of the country’s most exciting and innovative food scenes, and the national press have been gushing in their praise including accolades from Food &amp; Wine, Esquire and Gourmet. Michael Symon was something of a catalyst, winning the Iron Chef award, and the Pièce De Résistance was Jonathon Sawyer winning the James Beard Award 2015 for Best Chef Great Lakes, with his iconic Cleveland restaurants Greenhouse Tavern, Trentina and Noodlecat.</p>
<p>As well as challenging nationally, Cleveland is the pre-eminent regional powerhouse for fine dining, and boasts over 1,700 restaurants altogether in the metropolitan area. Cleveland’s relatively low population density means that people largely need to travel to dine out in restaurants, and this coupled with intense winters means that reservations are very popular amongst Cleveland’s dining public. Perhaps as many as 400 Cleveland restaurants accept reservations in general, in response to this public need.</p>
<p>Reserving a table online is useful for both guest and restaurant. For the guest, online bookings allow convenience, as they can book a reservation 24/7, regardless of whether there is a skilled telephonist in the restaurant. The guest experience is enhanced when they receive an instant confirmation of the booking by email, with all of the reservation details, giving them assurance of their plans. For the restaurant, online booking software offer a conduit for bookings 24/7 at minimal cost. With EVEVE technology, each online booking is structured as if the restaurateur had placed it personally, and adopting the “EVEVE Method” of managing reservations has been proven to drive profitability.</p>
<p>In terms of restaurants accepting online reservations, however, a relatively small number of Cleveland restaurants deploy a live reservation system. Currently just 160 locations in the greater Cleveland metropolitan area deploy live restaurant booking software, which is significantly less than metropolitan areas with similar populations, such as Minneapolis (approximately 350); Denver (400); and Seattle (400). There are a multitude of reasons why one city may offer more choice of live reservation taking restaurants than another, but one which really stood out in Cleveland, until recently, was a severe was a lack of choice.</p>
<p>The issue facing Cleveland restaurants (and indeed their compatriots throughout Ohio) was that if they wanted to deploy live reservation software, they were served by just one monopoly restaurant reservation supplier, Opentable, which enjoyed market share in the bookings market of over 99%. Opentable is well known to provide a quality reservation product and professional service, but like any monopoly when there is only one supplier, prices were inevitably uncompetitive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.monco.info/eveve/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Restaurant_Booking_System__Cleveland_Ohio_Columbus_Cincinnati_Toledo_Akron2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5912 size-large" src="http://www.monco.info/eveve/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Restaurant_Booking_System__Cleveland_Ohio_Columbus_Cincinnati_Toledo_Akron2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Restaurant_Booking_System__Cleveland_Ohio_Columbus_Cincinnati_Toledo_Akron2" width="1024" height="683" /></a></p>
<p>In June 2015 the situation changed profoundly when the Flying Fig became the first restaurant in Cleveland to join EVEVE. The highly regarded Flying Fig was soon joined by Tomo in downtown Cleveland, serving some of Ohio’s best Sushi and Hibachi. West of Cleveland, Lakewood’s most exciting new opening of 2015, Sarita, opened with EVEVE. Acclaimed chef Jaret Havanchak was next to reposition with EVEVE, with his acclaimed Sushi and Seafood restaurant, Lure in Willoughby. Most recently, Chardon’s finest restaurant, Square Bistro, has begun to accept online reservations with EVEVE.</p>
<p>Why are restaurants rushing to join EVEVE? There are four core reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>First is that EVEVE has proven across 300 case studies that it can match any restaurant reservation supplier for online diner volume, so restaurants can be confident that their business will not skip a beat by switching.</li>
<li>Second, EVEVE’s TELOS reservation system is amongst the best around, and is peerless at maximising a restaurant’s guest volume, without compromising the diner experience.</li>
<li>Third, EVEVE provides local Cleveland based installation, training and account management, and is one of only two suppliers to support Ohio on the ground.</li>
<li>Finally, EVEVE provides dramatic cost savings to its new partner restaurants in Ohio.</li>
</ol>
<p>EVEVE’s combination of cutting edge bookings technology and dedicated account management combine to drive online reservations like no other supplier. In addition, many restaurants are attracted to the fact that EVEVE is a white label solution, rather than a middleman or broker. EVEVE does not promote itself to the restaurant’s diners nor does it promote other restaurants to their own user base. Indeed, many diners use EVEVE software without even knowing it.</p>
<p>EVEVE is very enthusiastic about the Cleveland and wider Ohio markets, and has made a strategic investment in the city, committing a locally based representative, David Hickey. David brings a wealth of restaurant experience having worked for the nationally known Great Lakes Brewing Company for a number of years. Timothy Ryan, EVEVE’s CEO added “Cleveland is one of America’s great historic cities, and like other Midwestern cities has been incredibly welcoming to EVEVE. We hope our new position here will help reduce reservations costs for hard working restaurateurs and their businesses.”</p>
<p>Beyond Cleveland, EVEVE now supports one of Columbus’ most exciting new restaurants, Copious, and provides onsite training and installation throughout Ohio, including Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron. EVEVE also supports Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania for onsite installations. Eastern Pennsylvania is handled by our Philadelphia team.</p>
<p>For restaurateurs looking to know more about how EVEVE can help drive their restaurant business, EVEVE offers onsite consultations throughout Ohio. These allow us to understand the particular restaurant business better, and showcase what reservations technology is most appropriate to build out and expand the restaurant and drive profitability. Whether you need the finest reservation software in Cleveland, just want to accept online bookings in Cincinnati, or need the very best table management software in Columbus, EVEVE have a solution which can help your restaurant!</p>

Find out about Philadelphia's burgeoning food scene and why these leading restaurants are choosing EVEVE.</em></p>
<p>Philadelphia is one of America's most established food cities, claiming some of the nation's finest and most popular restaurants, and is a hub of new activity as a raft of new eateries open over coming months. As millennials move in to the city and it becomes ever more densely populated, eating out and fine dining is becoming a way of life for many in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>As a global international powerhouse in terms of economic power and fine-dining clout, it may be no surprise to find that greater Philadelphia is one of the world's ten largest restaurant reservation markets, by online diner volume, with well over 800 restaurants accepting online reservations in the greater metropolitan area. Aside from sheer number, Philadelphia also has some of the nation's most booked restaurants and ranks amongst the highest in terms of reservations per capita. Outside of Philadelphia itself, there are significant concentrations of online restaurant bookings in Collingswood, Cherry Hill, King of Prussia and Conshohocken.</p>
<p>Booking a table online is useful for both the diner and restaurateur. For the diner, online bookings allow convenience, as they can book a reservation 24/7, regardless of whether there is a skilled telephonist in the restaurant. Moreover the diner receives an instant confirmation by email, giving them assurance of their plans. For the restaurant, online reservations offer a conduit for bookings 24/7 at minimal cost. With Eveve technology, each online booking is structured as if the restaurateur had placed it personally.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.monco.info/eveve/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Restaurant_Reservation_System_Philadelphia_Pennsylvania_Maryland_Delaware_New_Jersey_2.jpg"><img class="  alignright wp-image-5917" src="http://www.monco.info/eveve/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Restaurant_Reservation_System_Philadelphia_Pennsylvania_Maryland_Delaware_New_Jersey_2-200x300.jpg" alt="Restaurant_Reservation_System_Philadelphia_Pennsylvania_Maryland_Delaware_New_Jersey_2" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>The problem facing restaurateurs in Philadelphia until 2015 (shared across Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland) was that if they wanted to make use of live reservations technology, they were served by just one monopoly supplier, Opentable, which enjoyed over 95% market share. Though Opentable provides a quality reservation product and professional service, like any monopoly situation when there is only one supplier, prices were inevitably uncompetitive.</p>
<p>In May 2015 the situation changed profoundly, as ten popular independent Philadelphia restaurants joined Eveve, within a few weeks of Eveve launching in the market. Karma, Barra, Bleu Martini, Vesper and Zento formerly used Opentable as their primary reservation supplier, but now use Eveve to place online bookings from their websites and social media outlets. In addition Guild Hall and b-Side have chosen Eveve, having never used a reservation system. The ten is made up by three further restaurants which will be installed by June 2nd. EVEVE expects to manage at least 5,000 online diners in June, and build from there.</p>
<p>Why are restaurants rushing to join EVEVE? The reservations supplier has proven it can deliver just as many online reservations per restaurant as Opentable, across 200 case studies. This is underpinned by world class reservations software and local, designated account managers. All this is provided at a tremendously competitive price, with restaurants typically saving 60-80% when switching to EVEVE, and sometimes as much as 90%.</p>
<p>In addition, many restaurants are attracted to the fact that EVEVE is a white label solution, rather than a middleman or broker. EVEVE does not promote itself to the restaurant's diners nor does it promote other restaurants to their own user base. Indeed, many diners use EVEVE software without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is EVEVE's fifth market in the USA, following success in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Houston, Seattle and Denver. EVEVE chose Minneapolis-St. Paul as its first target market in 2011, and the company now manages the online reservations for eight of the Twin Cities' 10 busiest independent restaurants, and over 50% of all online diner reservations in the state. In Texas, EVEVE serves four of the top 10 most booked restaurants in Houston, as well as acclaimed fine dining establishments, such as Fresh Fish and Barley Swine (in Austin). Seattle became EVEVE's third market in November, and 15 restaurants now utilise the company's product across the greater metropolitan area. In Denver Eveve manages the reservations for 25 restaurants and over 20,000 online diners per month.</p>
<p>EVEVE is very enthusiastic about the Philadelphia market, and has made a strategic investment in the city, committing to locally based sales and technical support teams. Timothy Ryan, EVEVE's CEO added "Philadelphia is one of America's most historic and important cities, with a firmly established fine dining scene, and rapid growth in quality new establishments. It was the standout choice for us as a hub for our East Coast operations, and we feel confident and privileged to invest in the city. We hope we can serve Philadelphia like we have our other cities, meaning lower overheads for restaurants."</p>
<p>EVEVE offers onsite installs throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware from its new base in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>If you have a restaurant in Philadelphia, wider Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware or Maryland, and need first class reservations technology and professional account management and training, but without the per diner cover fees, call EVEVE's local team in Philadelphia today, and they will be delighted to visit with you in person.</p>

Find out about the Denver restaurant reservation scene, how it is changing, and why these leading restaurants have switched to EVEVE!</em></p>
<p>Denver has one of America's strongest independent restaurant communities. With so many restaurants at the vanguard of modern American cuisine, the city sets the benchmark for the Mountain West when it comes to fine dining. Denver's economy is amongst the Nation's most buoyant, and as incomes rise and the city grows, the demand for fine dining is set to grow even faster than the city in general.</p>
<p>In line with its leading position as a technology and restaurant hub, in 2015 Denver is already one of the most heavily penetrated markets globally, in terms of online reservations for restaurants. With over 600 restaurants accepting online reservations in Colorado, the State has one of highest rates of online booking in America, and indeed the world. Beyond Denver itself, there are significant concentrations of online restaurant bookings in Boulder, Aurora, Lakewood, Aspen, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs, Greenwood Village and Durango.</p>
<p>Online reservations confer many advantages for both the dining public, and restaurateurs. For the diner, the live restaurant reservation system affords a higher degree of convenience, for they can make a reservation at any time which suits them, regardless of whether there is a vacant receptionist to take the booking. Immediately after booking, confirmation is automatically emailed, conferring peace of mind. For the restaurateur, online reservations offer the ability to take bookings 24/7 at minimal cost. Moreover, each online reservation is structured according to the restaurateur's exact parameters, to ensure that it would be taken exactly as if by them personally.</p>

<div class="post-content">
<div class="post-excerpt">
<p>The problem facing restaurateurs in Denver until 2015 (shared across Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas and Nebraska) was that they were served by just one monopoly reservations supplier, Opentable, which enjoyed over 95% market share. Though Opentable provides a quality reservation product and professional service, like any monopoly situation when there is only one supplier, prices are inevitably uncompetitive.</p>
<p>In January 2015 the situation changed drastically. Three of Denver's most critically acclaimed restaurants - Charcoal, Old Major and Sarcoa - have switched reservation supplier from Opentable to EVEVE. Charcoal, one of Denver's fine dining champions, specialises in modern European cuisine, and managed thousands of online diners each month. Sarcoa is widely considered Denver's finest Japanese restaurant and tables are a much prized commodity. Old Major is one of the hottest tables in town, with one of the highest ratios of online reservations to seats in Colorado. These three are joined by The Curtis Club and Cedar Creek, which have also recently switched to EVEVE within the past couple of weeks. All told, EVEVE now expects to manage around 7,000 online diners per month in Colorado.</p>
<p>Why are so many restaurants switching to EVEVE? EVEVE has proven it can deliver just as many online reservations per restaurant as Opentable, across 200 case studies. This is underpinned by world class reservations software and local, designated account managers. All this is provided at a tremendously competitive price, with restaurants typically saving 60-80% when switching to EVEVE, and sometimes as much as 90%.</p>
<p>Many restaurants are attracted to the fact that EVEVE is a white label solution, rather than a middleman or broker. EVEVE does not promote itself to the restaurant's diners nor does it promote other restaurants. Indeed, many diners use EVEVE software without even knowing it. This was a major selling point for Charcoal's owner, Gary Sumihiro who said "Charcoal Restaurant has reached a stage where it wants to control its own reservations and branding rather than through a third party."</p>
<p>Denver is EVEVE's fourth market, following success in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Houston and Seattle. EVEVE chose Minneapolis-St. Paul as its first target market in 2011, and the company now manages the online reservations for nine of the Twin Cities' 10 busiest independent restaurants, and over 50% of all online diner reservations in the state. In Texas, EVEVE serves five of the top 10 most booked restaurants, as well as acclaimed fine dining establishments, such as Fresh Fish and Barley Swine (in Austin). Seattle became EVEVE's third market in November, and 15 restaurants now utilise the company's product across the greater metropolitan area.</p>
<p>EVEVE is very enthusiastic about the Denver market, and has made a strategic investment in the city, committing to locally based sales and technical support teams. Timothy Ryan, EVEVE's CEO added "Denver has one of America's most accomplished and innovative fine dining restaurant scenes. Unfortunately the choice of quality restaurants was not mirrored by a corresponding choice of restaurant reservation partner, until now. That combination made Denver the outstanding choice for us. We hope that we will be able to serve Denver like we have other markets, meaning lower overheads for restaurants. Ultimately these savings can be passed on to diners"</p>
<p>EVEVE offers onsite installs throughout Colorado from its new base in Denver. Furthermore, Denver will also serve the restaurant communities in Kansas, Nebraska, Utah and Wyoming, again offering onsite sales visits and installation in those states.</p>
<p>If you have a restaurant in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Utah or Wyoming, and are looking for best in class reservation technology, first rate account management and training, but without the per diner cover fees, call EVEVE's Denver team today, and they will be delighted to visit with you in person:</p>
<p><b>Benjamin Brecht, Denver, Colorado: 770 335 6733</b></p>
<p>Benjamin covers Denver, Aspen, Aurora, Colorado Springs, Durango, Boulder, Lakewood, Fort Collins and Greenwood Village in Colorado; together with Utah, Wyoming,Kansas and Nebraska.</p>

<p><em>Looking for a restaurant reservation system in Seattle or the Pacific Northwest? If so, look no further than Eveve, which now offers restaurants in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and British Columbia the definitive solution.</em></p>
<p>Seattle is America's fastest growing major city, with one of the Nation's most diverse and accomplished restaurant communities. As the population density of the city increases markedly, reservations have become an increasingly important element of the dining experience, particularly for fine dining restaurants looking to best manage their tables. Reservations also benefit diners who wish to make plans, and do not like uncertainty or lengthy waiting times. Studies show that reservations are made disproportionately by those who are resource rich, but time poor-exactly the kind of diners which fine dining restaurants want. As disposable income in Seattle continues to rise further, the appetite for fine dining and reservations will continue to grow.</p>
<p>For establishments where reservations are part of the very fabric of the dining experience, online reservations systems have a beneficial impact on the restaurants in terms of improving the guest experience and maximising online bookings by facilitating them 24/7. Reservation systems also help build a customer database and provide a foundation for valuable marketing activities. Beyond this, Eveve provides the most comprehensive and powerful table inventory management tool available, which minimises unnecessary wastage of tables and maximises revenue for restaurants.</p>
<p>The problem for Seattle and Pacific Northwest restaurateurs is that in the past 18 months, was that for those who expressed a desire for a live restaurant booking system, there was just one choice - Opentable. Prior to mid-2013, restaurateurs had a viable alternative in the form of Rezbook, the booking platform created by Urbanspoon. While not quite as advanced as Opentable's reservation system and table management, Rezbook did provide a competent entry level booking system, at a competitive price. Most importantly, the very element of competition meant that prices in the Seattle restaurant reservation systems market could never become excessive.</p>
<h3>REZBOOK NO LONGER AN ALTERNATIVE</h3>
<p>Unfortunately that dynamic changed in July 2013 when Opentable purchased Rezbook by Urbanspoon, and in an instant moved from an approximate 75-85% market share to an effective 100% share. Consequently, many restaurateurs in Seattle are looking for an alternative to Rezbook. Like any market, when one monopoly supplier controls the supply, the result is uncompetitive prices and service.</p>
<p>Luckily for Seattle and the Pacific Northwest's restaurateur communities, that changed in November 2014, when America's second largest reservation supplier, by online reservations, entered the Seattle market. Eveve was launched in the USA in 2011 in the Twin Cities, and the company was fortunate to be received with open arms, quickly moving into the leading position in the State. Today nine of the 10 busiest independent restaurants in Minnesota choose Eveve. With Minnesota anchoring the Midwest, Eveve chose Houston as its Southern base of operations, and now five of Houston's 10 busiest restaurants also use the solution.</p>
<p>Eveve chose Seattle to anchor its West Coast operations, rather than the more usual choice of San Francisco. Why? We caught up with Timothy John Ryan, Eveve's CEO, to find out: "For us, Seattle was the clear front runner. The city and the broader metropolitan area, including Tacoma and Bellevue, boast some of America's best restaurants. Moreover, Seattle, has perhaps the most exciting tech scene in America right now, with locally based companies making global waves such as Microsoft, Expedia and Amazon. Additionally, it is pretty rare these days to find a major city in America with such an unrestricted monopoly. Even San Francisco or Vancouver [British Columbia] have more competition. Finally, the weather seems similar to our native Scotland-so how could we resist?".</p>
<p>EVEVE offers a compelling service to Seattle and the Pacific Northwest's best restaurants. EVEVE's biggest unique selling point is the quality of its reservation system and table management software, which is one of the most accomplished tools available anywhere, designed to handle high volume, large restaurants. Moreover, it offers peerless yield management tools and information, which mean that restaurants are best placed to maximise their reservations. What makes the EVEVE proposition unique, is that the fees are based on a banded licence fee model and rather than a charge per diner booked online. In practical terms, this means dramatic savings, particularly for the busiest restaurants. You can find more about EVEVE offerings <a href="https://www.eveve.com/restaurants.htm">here</a></p>
<p>To best serve the Seattle and broader Pacific Northwest restaurant community, EVEVE have invested locally, and recruited a talented local representative, Crystal Montgomery. Though based in Seattle, Crystal is specifically tasked with serving the entirety of Washington and EVEVE offers onsite service throughout the State including Spokane, Bellevue, Tacoma, Vancouver, Everett, Kent, Kirkland, Yakima and Renton. Moreover, Crystal will also be helping restaurants in Vancouver, British Columbia, Portland, the State of Oregon and Idaho, again with onsite visits.</p>
<p>If your restaurant is based in Washington, British Columbia, Idaho or Oregon, do not delay, call our Northwest team today:</p>

<p><em>Find out the history of booking systems in Texas and why EVEVE became the state's fastest growing restaurant reservation system provider. Get more information on what ways EVEVE is shaking up Houston's online booking market and its plans for Austin, Dallas and San Antonio. Most importantly, this article shows why this is all great news for Texan restaurateurs.</em></p>
<p>Texas has perhaps the most vibrant economy in the USA, and nowhere can that growth be seen more clearly than in the explosion of its restaurant scenes. The Houston and Dallas restaurant sectors are now amongst the most eclectic and accomplished in the country, while Austin punches well above its weight on the national stage, with some of America's most exciting restaurants. Meanwhile, San Antonio, one of America's most historic and beautiful cities, has a wealth of top restaurants, and the famous River Walk.</p>
<p>With burgeoning restaurant scenes in each of these four cities, reservations have become an increasingly important aspect of the dining experience, for fine dining restaurants looking to best manage their table inventories, and diners who wish to make plans, and do not like uncertainty or lengthy waiting times. Indeed studies show, that reservations are made disproportionately by those who are resource rich, but time poor - exactly the kind of diners which fine dining restaurants want. As disposable income in Texas rises further, particularly in markets like Houston, and real estate becomes more expensive, this booking culture is most likely to increase further.</p>
<p>While reservations made by telephone have always been a good way to accept bookings, the problem is that typically a restaurant will only man the telephone lines between 30 and 80 hours per week, and even then, the telephonist may be engaged on another call, with diners in the restaurant, or not available for some other reason. Even when a booking call is answered, the telephonist is sometimes not best placed to make a decision about whether to accommodate the diner, or offer an alternative time, due to a lack of information or experience.</p>
<p>A Live Booking System addresses these issues by offering real time reservations 24/7. Moreover, every online reservation is structured within the restaurateur's parameters, to ensure that it would be taken exactly as he would. This is the main reason why around 1,100 restaurants in Texas make use of a real time reservation system, and between them, they manage an estimated seven-eight million online diners per year.</p>
<p>The problem with restaurant reservations systems for restaurants in Texas, until recently, was that they faced one single monopoly supplier, Opentable. Though Opentable provides a professional service and capable product, like any situation, with one predominant supplier, prices can become extremely uncompetitive.</p>
<p>After a very successful US launch of its live reservation in Minnesota, EVEVE selected Houston as its anchor for the Southern United States. With a thriving restaurant scene, huge growth potential, and comparatively little competition, it seemed like a great option.</p>
<p>EVEVE offers a most compelling service to Texas' best restaurants. EVEVE's biggest unique selling point is the quality of its reservation system and table management software, which is one of the most accomplished tools available anywhere, designed to handle high volume, large restaurants. Moreover, it offers peerless yield management tools and information, which mean that restaurants are best placed to maximise their reservations. What makes the EVEVE proposition unique, is that its fees are based on a banded licence fee model and does not charge per diner booked online. In practical terms, this means dramatic savings, particularly for the busiest restaurants. You can find more about <a href="https://www.eveve.com/restaurants.htm">EVEVE offerings here</a></p>
<p>After a ten year near monopoly on restaurant booking systems, it seems Houston was ready for some competition and has been incredibly welcoming to EVEVE. In just a few months, close to 50 restaurants have joined EVEVE, the majority switching from an alternative reservation supplier. EVEVE now has a team of five in Texas, covering sales, technical support and customer service, who are tasked with providing the best possible reservation software and service to its growing client base.</p>
<p>In Houston, EVEVE now places over 40,000 online diners per month, or 25% of the total online reservations in the metro area. Many of Houston's very busiest restaurants, by online reservations, including Brasserie 19, Benjy's, Ibiza and Kata Robata now choose EVEVE. Moreover, some of the city's most acclaimed gastronomic hotspots including Fresh Fish (which switched from SeatMe), Pax Americana and Latin Bites find EVEVE is best placed to maximise their reservations and drive revenue. EVEVE also provides great value for local independents such as Colombe d'Or, Azuma and Tony Mandola's.</p>
<p>With so much going on, restaurants in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio have started to ask why they too cannot enjoy the benefits of EVEVE. Barley Swine, in Austin, became EVEVE's first non-Houston client, and as a James Beard 2014 nominee, it is a great initial restaurant to have the opportunity to work with. Most recently, the Highball, Austin's favourite karaoke venue, went live with EVEVE this week.</p>
<p>EVEVE now offers onsite installation and training in Houston, as well as Dallas, Austin and San Antonio. To find out how EVEVE can maximise your bookings and increase your revenue, whilst saving you money, call our Houston team today on 713 701 5383.</p>

TELOS by Eveve could be the system which you have been looking for.</em></p>
<p>The Spanish speaking world encompasses some of the world's great culinary cultures, and many of its top restaurants. In historic Spain, restaurants such as El Cellar de Can Roca, Mugaritz, Arzak and Diverxo lead the world in accomplished fine dining, and Spanish cuisine has gone on to rival (and arguably surpass) French Haute Cuisine as the world's most distinguished. Today, Latin America now sports some of the world's best restaurants, including Central and Astrid y Gaston (Peru), Pujol (Mexico) and Mestizo (Chile). The region is also home to some of the most exciting culinary innovation anywhere, which is being replicated and imitated from Los Angeles to London.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that the Spanish speaking world is amongst the foremost in world cuisine, but in one area, until recently it has been a little behind the Anglosphere. That field was online reservations. Diners in London, New York or Los Angeles have been accustomed to making a reservation online at the top restaurants for ten years now. Savvy diners love the speed, convenience, and instant confirmation email which online bookings for restaurants offer.</p>
<p>Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, the Basque Country and Lima have some of the finest restaurants anywhere, and there is no doubt that the same dynamics behind reservations operate in those places. Indeed many Spanish speaking restaurants' whole businesses are based around reservations. Despite this, however, the reservation industry has been a little slow to react to demand.</p>
<p>No longer! After a successful year trialling its system in Chile and Spain, Eveve has now released its latest version in Spanish, meaning that for the first time, Spanish speaking restaurants can enjoy one of the very finest reservation systems available, in Spanish. Moreover, several of Eveve's employees are Spanish speaking natives, so support and installation is conducted in Spanish. Restaurants which want the best Spanish language reservation system which money can buy, should call our representatives in Spain or Chile:</p>
